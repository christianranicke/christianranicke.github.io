The Ernst Thalmann monument was built in Berlin to remember a very controversial communist leader who ran against Hitler. The constantly evolving graffiti on this monument stands out to me as a reflection of the culture in Berlin today. Being known for its creative art scene, Berlin seeks solutions to their problems in an attempt to find what is true and good. Just like the layers of graffiti on this monument, these solutions have often cluttered the city and left people in disunity and confusion. I am excited to visit Berlin this summer and contribute to the evolving art scene there. It is good to have some perspective on the motives of many artists there.
